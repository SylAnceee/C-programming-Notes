# Operators in C

Operators in C are symbols that perform operations on operands. Operands can be variables, constants, or expressions. Here's a summary of various types of operators:

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. 

| Operator | Name | Description | Example |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| +        | Addition | Adds two operands. | a + b   |
| -        | Subtraction | Subtracts the second operand from the first. | a - b   |
| *        | Multiplication | Multiplies two operands. | a * b |
| /        | Division | Divides the first operand by the second. | a / b   |
| %        | Modulus | Returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second. | a % b   |
| ++       | Increment | Increments the value of the operand by 1. | a++     |
| --       | Decrement | Decrements the value of the operand by 1. | a--     |

## Logical Operators

Logical operators perform logical AND, OR, and NOT operations. 

| Operator | Name | Description | Example |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| &&       | Logical AND | Returns true if both operands are true. | (a > 0) && (b < 10) |
| \|\|     | Logical OR | Returns true if either operand is true.  | (a == 0) \|\| (b == 0) |
| !        | Logical NOT | Returns true if the operand is false and vice versa. | !(a > b) |

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

| Operator | Name | Description | Example |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| =        | Assignment | Assigns the value of the right operand to the left operand. | a = 10  |
| +=       | Addition assignment | Adds the value of the right operand to the left operand. | a += 5 |
| -=       | Subtraction assignment | Subtracts the value of the right operand from the left operand. | a -= 5 |
| *=       | Multiplication assignment | Multiplies the left operand by the right operand. | a *= 5 |
| /=       | Division assignment | Divides the left operand by the right operand. | a /= 5 |
| %=       | Modulus assignment | Computes the modulus of the left operand with the right operand. | a %= 5 |

## Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to compare values.

| Operator | Name | Description | Example |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| ==       | Equal to | Returns true if the operands are equal. | a == b  |
| !=       | Not equal to | Returns true if the operands are not equal. | a != b |
| >        | Greater than | Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand. | a > b   |
| <        | Less than | Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand. | a < b   |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to | Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand. | a >= b |
| <=       | Less than or equal to | Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand. | a <= b |

## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators perform operations at the bit level. They are used to manipulate individual bits of operands.

| Operator | Name | Description | Example |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| &        | Bitwise AND | Performs a binary AND operation. | a & b   |
| \|       | Bitwise OR  | Performs a binary OR operation.  | a \| b   |
| ^        | Bitwise XOR | Performs a binary XOR operation. | a ^ b   |
| ~        | Bitwise NOT | Inverts all the bits of the operand. | ~a      |
| <<       | Left shift  | Shifts bits to the left by a specified number of positions. | a << 1  |
| >>       | Right shift | Shifts bits to the right by a specified number of positions. | a >> 1  |
